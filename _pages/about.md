## Welcome!

I'm a passionate Linux Administrator with interests in DevOps and Platform Engineering. This blog is where I share my experiences, tutorials, and thoughts on technology.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Technical Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides on various technologies
- **Best Practices**: Insights from real-world experience
- **Tools & Scripts**: Useful utilities and automation scripts
- **Tech Insights**: Analysis of emerging technologies and trends

### My Background

**Hi, I'm Victor!** 👋

I'm a Linux Systems Administrator and Platform Engineer based in Nigeria, with a passion for the terminal, automation, and making systems run smoother. If you've ever wondered what makes someone fall in love with the green screen from hacker movies—yeah, that was me. Those Hollywood terminals sparked a curiosity that turned into a two-year (and counting) journey into the world of Linux and infrastructure.

**My Journey into Tech**


My path into technology wasn't traditional, but it's been driven by one thing: the urge to build a better future for myself and my family. That drive pushed me to dive deep into Linux, scripting, automation, and platform engineering. I got my start volunteering with my school's JETS club (Junior Engineers, Technicians and Scientists), where I discovered that I genuinely loved helping others understand technology.
These days, I'm freelancing and sharpening my skills. I'm sitting for my **RHCSA** in April 2026, and I've already got my sights set on crushing the RHCE right after. My motto? "Not end of the week, end of the day." If something can be done today, why wait?




**What I'm About**

I hold my values in high esteem. Integrity, continuous learning, and helping others grow—these aren't just words to me, they're how I operate. My friends call me "the nerdiest dude" (and I wear that badge proudly), but I think what really defines me is my drive to get things done and done right.



**Beyond the Terminal**

When I'm not deep in configs or writing scripts, you'll find me:

- 🎮 Gaming...yeahhh, because even admins need to unwind

- 🎵 Listening to music...My fuel for coding sessions

- 🍳 Cooking and exploring different cuisines. I love experimenting in the kitchen as much as I do in the shell

- 📧 Email marketing. Yes, really! There's an art to crafting the perfect message

- 🥾 Hiking - Getting out in nature to clear my head (though not as often as I'd like)

- 📚 Hanging out on Reddit and Discord. I love thisss


**What You'll Find on This Blog**

This is where I share what I'm learning, building, and breaking (and then fixing). Expect:

Linux tutorials and tips - Real-world solutions to real problems
Platform engineering insights - How to build better infrastructure
Automation scripts - Making life easier, one script at a time
Certification journey - Documenting my path through RHCSA and beyond
DevOps best practices - Lessons learned in the trenches
Open source projects - Tools and utilities I'm building

**Let's Connect!**

I believe in the power of community and shared knowledge. Whether you're just starting out in Linux, preparing for your own certification, or you're a seasoned pro with some wisdom to share—I'd love to hear from you.
